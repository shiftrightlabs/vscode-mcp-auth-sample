# Azure OAuth Configuration (Public Client - PKCE)
# This is a PUBLIC CLIENT - no client secret required!
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=your-azure-client-id
AZURE_TENANT_ID=your-azure-tenant-id

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000

# IMPORTANT: AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET is NO LONGER NEEDED
# This implementation uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
# which is the secure OAuth 2.1 standard for public clients.
#
# Public clients include:
#   - React/SPA applications
#   - Mobile apps
#   - VS Code extensions (like this MCP server)
#   - Any code distributed to end users
#
# For setup instructions, see: AZURE_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SETUP.md
